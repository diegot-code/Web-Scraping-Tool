# Web Scraping Tool

## Objective
Develop a Python script that performs web scraping to extract information from a website. This project will help you understand the basics of web scraping and data extraction.

## Key Features
1. **User Input:** Allow the user to input the URL of a website they want to scrape.
2. **Data Extraction:** Utilize a web scraping library (e.g., BeautifulSoup or Scrapy) to extract relevant information from the specified webpage. This could be headlines, quotes, or any other text-based content.
3. **Output Options:** Provide options for the user to save the extracted data to a file (e.g., CSV or text file).
4. **Error Handling:** Implement error handling to manage potential issues during the scraping process.

## Technologies
- **Python:** Use Python as the primary language for scripting.
- **Web Scraping Library:** Choose a library such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for web scraping.
- **VS Code:** Stick with your preferred IDE (VS Code).

## Instructions
1. Begin by setting up a new Python script in VS Code.
2. Use input statements to allow the user to input the URL of the website they want to scrape.
3. Implement the web scraping logic using the chosen library to extract relevant data.
4. Provide options for the user to save the extracted data to a file.
5. Add error handling to manage potential issues during the web scraping process.
6. Test your script with different websites to ensure its robustness.
